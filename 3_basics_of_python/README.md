# Basics of Python

In this chapter we will finally start working with Python. We will cover follwowing topics:

1. Numbers and basic arythmetic
1. Variables
1. Comments
1. Comparison and If-Else statements
1. Text
1. Lists
1. For loops
1. Dictionaries
1. Functions
1. Importing modules


During the course of this module you will also have to solve some excerises yourself to get more familiar with those concepts and learn to use them in new ways. Dont worry if you have problems though. Starting out on this journey can be dauting at first, but we will go trough those excercises toghether if needed. I will also try to provide links to articles or documentation that can help in solving those tasks.

# Chapter structure

This chapter is broken down into multiple sections. For each section there are 3 notebooks:

1. section_name_**lecture**.ipynb - this one we will go over toghether during the lection part. You are encouraged to write your own version of this notebook along the lecture video or you can use the premade lecture notebook and simply run the cells and observe results
1. section_name_**excercise**.ipynb - you will have to work on this one by yourself. There will be both quiz-like questions and code challanges to complete.
1. section_name_**solution**.ipynb - we will one more time go over toghether explaining how to solve the problems

# How to run those notebooks

Download lecture zip from xxxx and unpack its content to a suitable directory. Copy over content of this repository to your user folder (TODO: more in depth instruction needed)

You can now run those notebooks in your Jupyter session. You may need to change the name of kernel (TODO: add screenshots) in case yours are named differently.
